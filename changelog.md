## Version 1.0.6
- Added Japanese voice language support for custom characters.
- Switching voice language for the custom characters now functions like it does in the base game, however base Sonic/EvilSonic require you to configure still.
- Mods using the old voice implimentation should still work, however they will be just as hit or miss as ever. This new method should be generally more consistent.
- Added generic day and night 1up icons.
